# Text 5

* Each character is encrypt to 2 hex values
* It is basically the same thing as [Text 4](../Text4)
* Difference is each pair of the hex is separate where the first one is in the first half of the encrypted text and the second one is in the second half. As well the first one is larger than the second one this time
